        <h1>About myself</h1>
        <p>My name is Nguyen Khac Duy Anh （阮客社安 - Ruan Ke She An）. I am from Vietnam. I am currently a first-year student majoring in computer science at Huazhong University of  Science and Technology, one of the top engineering universities in China. My decision to study computer science and technology originates from my passion for technology and its revolutionary potential. I am so fascinated by the infinite possibilities that this field can offer that I aspire to contribute to advancements in computer science.  </p>

        <p>If I were asked about the most valuable achievements from my childhood to the present, my answer would undoubtedly include the gold medal - the first prize of the MakeX Robotics Competition Vietnam Finals 2019 and the honor of representing the national team at the MakeX Robotics Competition World Championship 2019 in China. While this event may not hold significant academic or talent value, it has served as a crucial moment and a driving force in shaping my future path. It was an unforgettable experience. This experience was an opportunity for me to explore and develop a deeper appreciation for our neighboring country China, a country that has experienced rapid development in science and technology applied in every aspect of society. This experience also sparked my dream of studying computer science and technology in China. </p>
